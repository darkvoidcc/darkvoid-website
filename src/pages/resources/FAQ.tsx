    question: 'How safe is it to use DarkVoid’s products?',
    answer: (
      <p className="txt-desc">
        We strive to ensure that our software is as safe as possible and conduct
        thorough tests and improvements on a regular basis. In our extensive
        testing, we have never encountered any automatic bans triggered by
        anti-cheat systems, and we guarantee 100% that you will not be
        automatically banned as a direct result of using our software. However,
        the use of such software inherently carries a certain level of risk for
        manual bans due to in-game reports, and we cannot guarantee complete
        protection against those. Game developers may still choose to enforce
        their Terms of Service and impose manual penalties. Therefore, we
        recommend that you exercise caution and always use our products
        responsibly.

    question: 'Have doubts about our safety and security?',
    answer: (
      <p className="txt-desc">
        This is a very frequent and common concern, and we completely understand
        it, as we clearly state that all of our software are 100% undetected and
        safe to use, you shouldn't be worried about safety when using any of our
        software. However we know that for many peoples our stated facts are not
        always enough, so incase you still have doubts which is totally normal,
        we recommend you to join our discord community where you can check our
        "reviews" text channel to see other customers reviews of our products.
        Thus you can also ask other customers about it, and interact with the
        whole community of darkvoid, and this way you will get an unbiased
        answer. We know that even this is not enough for some but unfortunately
        there is no other ways for us to further prove our safety.

    question: 'Which payment methods do you accept?',
    answer: (
      <p className="txt-desc">
        We accept payments from both international and Russian credit cards. To
        ensure authenticity and quality, we do not support resellers, and our
        official products can only be purchased directly through this website.
        As payments are fully automated, you will receive your license key and a
        download link to the software via email immediately after completing
        your purchase, allowing you to start using the product right away. It’s
        also very important to note that all of our purchase links are for
        one-time purchases, not recurring subscription-based plans.

    question: 'Where can I get help if I face software issues?',

        We offer help to all our customers through our official Discord server.
        There, you can request HWID resets for free, receive support from our
        team, create tickets for custom reasons, and interact with other users.

        solutions. We focus on providing straightforward and minimalistic
